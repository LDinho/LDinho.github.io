      To git or not to git? The answer is definitely a resounding, "yes indeed, I should want to git as a software developer." Not to git is like having a prolific writer who constantly makes changes using a pencil without the eraser. In the end, he would likely be stuck with a messy finished written prose on paper. Fortunately, there is git.

      Git is a free and open source version control system that helps coders around the world save different versions of their code on their local computer. Git is able to achieve this by adding and saving any changes to its memory at a certain point in time. This is done via what git calls a “commit”. One can make changes pretty much at any single point in time, and also revert to a previous preferred state of one's code.

      In addition, there is the option of using git's online cousin, GitHub. GitHub is simply a pretty powerful online web app where you store and send all those changes/versions of your code to. GitHub also does an excelllent job creating an environment where developers are able to share/collaborate with others on projects. Git and GitHub are able to communicate with each other through simple commands, such as, git push (to GitHub), git pull (from GitHub). As you collaborate on a project, you can also use git to create different versions (or “branches” with their own versions) of a project where collaborators can contribute their own version of a code. Later, if all collaborators agree, everyone can push and merge their individual code into one “master branch” version to GitHub.  Developers use git and GitHub to track changes as they are both especially useful when team members are working on projects simultaneously.

      Git and his "cousin" GitHub, are a coder's best companion indeed!

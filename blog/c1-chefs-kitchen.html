      Are there too many cooks in the kitchen when learning web development? Nope, let's all be cooks in the kitchen. That is the mindset that Shereef Bishay, one of the co-founders of Dev Bootcamp, would like new students to start embracing throughout their journey studying web development. In a restaurant, he says, it takes the collaborative work of all the cooks in the kitchen, no matter what their level of expertise is, for the creation of an awesome stew. Even when there's a mess, a fellow cook is there to fix it. Coding in general or when learning how to code should not be that much different. Some of the best projects come from a team of coders working together, in the good times and bad times, to create awesome code.

      Teamwork is important. And I think that's what the DBC experience is all about and more -- getting together, empathetically working together, and bouncing creative ideas off the minds of everyone in the group. In addition, DBC seems to care about the well-being of students emotionally and physically.That's always a plus when choosing to be part of a particular learning environment.

      I am all for participating and playing my role in the DBC kitchen. I may feel a little nervous, but I'm still excited to be part of this journey. For now, I'm ok being the noobie cook learning to create wonderful dishes full of exquisite code. And I hope that DBC will continue to guide me in the right direction to become another chef in the developer kitchen.
